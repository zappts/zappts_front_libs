## ✏️ About

Ever had the problem of needing to create a component so your user can select a date range and use it elsewhere in your project?

The ideal in these cases is to use a calendar, however building one from zero can be a little time-consuming and, consequently, costly for the development of your project.

Well, as I've also been through this problem, I created this little project to show my solution and help anyone looking for an easy and customizable way to use a calendar component :)

## 💻 Technology

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## 📙 About

You know that very complex feature that you really needed to deliver but didn't have enough time to implement it with pure HTML/CSS/JS then had to resort to using libraries?

So here we are going to provide very simple implementations of using the lib that another dev can use as a basis to solve something similar :)

## 🛠️ How to use
